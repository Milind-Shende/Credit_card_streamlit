## 💳 Credit Card Default Prediction

**This is a machine learning model for predicting credit card default. The model uses historical credit card data to determine the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payments.This is a classification model for a most common dataset, Credit Card defaulter prediction. Prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers.**

## 📙 Dataset Source

**In our dataset we have 25 columns 30000 Rows which reflect various attributes of the customer. The target column is default.payment.next.month , which reflects whether the customer defaulted or not. Our aim is to predict the probability of default given the payment history of the customer. I have built my model using a public dataset available on kaggle.**

## 🧘 Motivation

**Credit card default is a major issue for financial institutions, leading to significant financial losses. As a result, it is important for banks and other lenders to be able to accurately predict which customers are at risk of defaulting on their credit card payments.**
